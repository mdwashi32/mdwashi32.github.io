				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/sfa2.jpg"></img>
				<p>Hello everyone! This is my first blog post for Art/CS 108: Introduction to Game Studies.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this post is to discuss my experience with a classic arcade game played through Internet Archive.</p>
				<p>I chose Street Fighter Alpha 2. When it comes to fighting games, this fan favorite is arguably a classic.</p>
				<p>This is not my first time playing the game and I am very familiar with the control scheme and combos.</p>
				<p>I didn't expect much from a web browser streaming of the game but I was very surprised. The game ran smoothly and it was almost like actually playing the game on an arcade cabinet.</p>
				<p>The primary issue I had with it was setting up controls. By trial and error I was able to figure out how to set inputs through an extremly grainy HUD. Even after that, playing on a keyboard just wasn't the same.</p>
				<p>I missed the feel of the ball-top joystick and hard buttons prominent in arcades. Something behind the nostalgia behind using those controls makes me feel like this browser version is missing something.</p>
				<p>Other than the controls, again, the game move smoothly. There was no lag or graphical error, and it was as if (minus the controls) I was standing right in front of an arcade cabinet.</p>
				<p>Internet Archive definitely achieved its goal of perserving a big piece of history.</p>

				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/kingoftokyo.jpg"></img>
				<p>The purpose of this assignment was write up a session report on a board game.</p>
				<p>King of Tokyo is a board game that uses the mechanisms area control/area influence, card drafting, dice rolling, player elimination, and press your luck.</p>
				<p>I chose to play King of Tokyo with three other class mates. From here on I will refer to us as player 1, player 2(me), player 3, player 4.</p>
				<p>At the start of the game, each player chooses a monster to play and receives its monster board. (This has no effect on gameplay and is purely aesthetic).</p>
				<p>Since we only had 4 players, the tokyo city version of the game was played. In order to win the game you want to wipe out the other players and be in Tokyo(the middle of the board).</p>
				<p>We started by shufffling the deck of 66 power cards and place three face up next to deck. Near the deck was also the energy cubes which are gained through rolling and used to purchase power cards.</p>
				<p>We chose who went first by rolling the 6 black die; the three green are only used with power cards.</p>
				<p>Player 1 rolled the highest number of attack so he got to start in the middle of Tokyo. The player in Tokyo attacks all outside and all outside attack player in Tokyo. A player in Tokyo may at any time yield the center to the player that ladt attacked.</p>
				<p>Round 1: Player 1 went, rerolled got 3 1s, a 2, an attack, and a heart. Heart and two do nothing. Player 1 gained 1 victory point and attacked everyone else who then lost one life.</p>
				<p>Player 2 (me): two attacks, one heart, two, and 3. I do not reroll. Double attacked player 1.</p>
				<p>Player 3: Rolled, rerolled, ended up with 4 2s (3 points) a heart and an energy.</p>
				<p>Player 4: Rolled, rerolled: 4 energy, 1 attack, one 3. Attacked player 1.</p>
				<p>Round 2: Player 1: Rolled two attack, 3 3s, and an energy, everyone lost two hearts.</p> 
				<p>Player 2: Rolled 4 3s, energy, 1</p>
				<p>Player 3: Rolled 2 attacked player 1, 1 heart, 2 energy, 1</p>
				<p>Player 4: Rolled 1 life, 2 attacks, 1 heart, 1 en - Player 1 yielded and player 2 becomes king.</p>
				<p>Round 3: Player 1: Rolled 3 2s, 1 attack to player 4 , 2 hearts</p>
				<p>Player 2: Rolled 5 en, 1 attack to player 4 - Player 4 yielded and I became king</p>
				<p>Player 3: Rolled 4 3s, attack, en</p>
				<p>Player 4: 4 3s, 1 heart, 2</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>Unfortunately the game did not conclude but it would have if either one of us received 20 points or if everyone's life counters (max 10) minus the kings were at 0</p>

				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/CloudsGlitch.jpg"></img>
				<p>The objective of this project was to use adobe photoshop and illustrator to create an image and then "glitch" the image by editing its code.</p>
				<p>The title of this piece is a play on the term cloud.</p>
				<p>In a way, technology is altering the way we perceive the natural world.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">MashUp Project - "Days"</h2>	
				<audio controls src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/Days.mp3">Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio>
				<p>The goal of this project was to mashup different art mediums together. </p> 
				<p>I chose to mashup and remix The Pharcyde - Runnin with Deadmau5 - Ghosts N Stuff.</p>
				<p>I own the rights to neither song.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Video Project - "Distortion"</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rn8BjloRssI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This video project was both filmed and edited by me.</p>
				<p>The idea behind it is that we have a distorted sense of reality due to our over-reliance on technology.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Processing Self-Portrait Project</h2>
				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/avatar1.png">
				<p>The objective here was to create a simple sketch of myself using processing.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Processing Video Project - "america"</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NiumqAQksY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>In this project, I used processing to create the American flag.</p>
				<p>The colorful pixels bouncing around the white stripes symbolize the diversity of America:</p>
				<p>We're all different colors, shapes, and sizes.</p>
