				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/sfa2.jpg"></img>
				<p>Hello everyone! This is my first blog post for Art/CS 108: Introduction to Game Studies.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this post is to discuss my experience with a classic arcade game played through Internet Archive.</p>
				<p>I chose Street Fighter Alpha 2. When it comes to fighting games, this fan favorite is arguably a classic.</p>
				<p>This is not my first time playing the game and I am very familiar with the control scheme and combos.</p>
				<p>I didn't expect much from a web browser streaming of the game but I was very surprised. The game ran smoothly and it was almost like actually playing the game on an arcade cabinet.</p>
				<p>The primary issue I had with it was setting up controls. By trial and error I was able to figure out how to set inputs through an extremly grainy HUD. Even after that, playing on a keyboard just wasn't the same.</p>
				<p>I missed the feel of the ball-top joystick and hard buttons prominent in arcades. Something behind the nostalgia behind using those controls makes me feel like this browser version is missing something.</p>
				<p>Other than the controls, again, the game move smoothly. There was no lag or graphical error, and it was as if (minus the controls) I was standing right in front of an arcade cabinet.</p>
				<p>Internet Archive definitely achieved its goal of perserving a big piece of history.</p>

				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/CloudsGlitch.jpg"></img>
				<p>The objective of this project was to use adobe photoshop and illustrator to create an image and then "glitch" the image by editing its code.</p>
				<p>The title of this piece is a play on the term cloud.</p>
				<p>In a way, technology is altering the way we perceive the natural world.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">MashUp Project - "Days"</h2>	
				<audio controls src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/Days.mp3">Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.</audio>
				<p>The goal of this project was to mashup different art mediums together. </p> 
				<p>I chose to mashup and remix The Pharcyde - Runnin with Deadmau5 - Ghosts N Stuff.</p>
				<p>I own the rights to neither song.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Video Project - "Distortion"</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rn8BjloRssI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This video project was both filmed and edited by me.</p>
				<p>The idea behind it is that we have a distorted sense of reality due to our over-reliance on technology.</p>

			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Processing Self-Portrait Project</h2>
				<img src="https://mdwashi32.github.io/avatar1.png">
				<p>The objective here was to create a simple sketch of myself using processing.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script">Processing Video Project - "america"</h2>
				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NiumqAQksY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>In this project, I used processing to create the American flag.</p>
				<p>The colorful pixels bouncing around the white stripes symbolize the diversity of America:</p>
				<p>We're all different colors, shapes, and sizes.</p>
