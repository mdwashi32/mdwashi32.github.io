				<h2 style="font-family: Oleo Script; padding:5px">Hello,</h2>
					<p>It's me again, Maurice.</p>
					<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this page.</p>
					<p>These projects were all a completely awesome experience for me. In my major, Computer Engineering, there isn't a lot of time alloted in classes to "have fun" so to speak. In no way am I saying that I didn't take my assignments in this class seriously, but I was allowed a lot more creative freedom than usual. Rather than studying computer languages and memorizing algorithms, I was allowed to do whatever I want (as long as it met the requirments for each assignment). I was able to express myself.</p>
					<p>Being around people from a different educational background was also important to me. I think that sometimes people, myself included, make the mistake of surrounding themselves with too many like minded people. It helps to immerse yourself in unfamiliar environments so that you can gain new insights and also more concretely affirm your own beliefs and passions.</p>
					<p>I even got to improve some of my technical skills by coding this website.</p>
					<p>At any rate thank you all of SJSU, and thank you reader again for taking the time to read this.</p>
